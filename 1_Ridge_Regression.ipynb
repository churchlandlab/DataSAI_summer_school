    "# Introduction to regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the typical ways to compute the relationship between independent variables $X$ and a dependent variable $Y$. Linear regression relates $X$ and $Y$ with a series of weights, which we will denote with $\\beta$ here.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\beta X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We usually know the values of $X$ and $Y$ so we must use these to then solve for $\\beta$. The typical way for solving a linear system of equations like this is to use ordinary least squares (OLS). OLS is the best unbiased estimator for a system of equations, but there are other types of regression that can achieve lower mean-squared errors, especially on unseen or held out data. OLS performs poorly in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- The number of predictors is high compared to the number of observations! OLS also has no unique solution when there are more predictors than samples (this is referred to as an underdetermined system), therefore it will cross-validate quite poorly in this regime. \n",
    "- *Multicollinearity*. Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are correlated . Correlated independent variables will lead to very poor cross-validation, and in some cases OLS will not even work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both of these scenarios are quite common in neural encoding models!** So we need a solution: **regularization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized regression (which includes ridge regression and lasso regression) works by punishing solutions with large $\\beta$ values, where OLS implies no restrictions on the $\\beta$ values that are found. This penalization reduces model variance, which translates to improve model predictions on held out data (ie. cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will implement OLS and ridge regression to see how their performance compares in different situations**."
