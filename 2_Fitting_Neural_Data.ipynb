    "\n",
    "Neural activity was recorded from mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with a head-mounted miniscope. During the miniscope recording, the mouse performed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. The mouse had to discriminate between high-frequency (> 12 Hz) and low-frequency (< 12 Hz) auditory click trains. Depending on whether the stimulus was above or below this threshold, the mouse must poke its nose into the left or right spout to receive a water reward. The recording chamber was equipped with high speed cameras to track animal movements.\n",
